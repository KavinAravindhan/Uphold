UpHold is an organizing platform that connects volunteers with NGOs and causes based on their skills using an ML algorithm for effective matching, ensuring everyone in the community can contribute actively. This project was developed during [HackZurich 2022](https://hackzurich.com/highlights-2022).

- Helps people become volunteers in a safe and easy way.
- Aggregates volunteering opportunities across different organizations and community actions.

## Key Features
