# UpHold

A Flutter project for Hackzurich 2022


Uphold is an organizing platform that enables volunteers, sponsors & causes to connect with each other in a simple way. Volunteers can select what types of things they're good at while NGOs or other individuals can create tasks that are looking for certain skills. We allow the individuals to choose the activities which interest them while our ML algorithm helps to match individuals with the skills to the requirements.
